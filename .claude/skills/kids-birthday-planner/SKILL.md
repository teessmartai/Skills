# Kids Birthday Planner Skill

Help parents plan a complete birthday celebration for their child by gathering requirements, researching local venues and services, and creating a comprehensive plan with options to choose from.

## Information Gathering Phase

Before planning, you MUST gather all the following information. Ask these questions conversationally, grouping related questions together.

### Required Information Checklist

- [ ] Child's age (turning how old?)
- [ ] Child's gender
- [ ] Child's interests and things they love (characters, hobbies, colors, activities)
- [ ] Any theme preferences

#### Date & Schedule
- [ ] Birthday date (exact date to determine if it falls on a school day)
- [ ] Does the child attend school/daycare?
- [ ] Preferred party date if different from birthday (usually a weekend)

#### Location & Logistics
- [ ] Home location (city/zip code for searching local options)
- [ ] Maximum acceptable drive time (default: 30 minutes)

#### Guest Information
- [ ] Number of kids to invite to the party
- [ ] Age range of invited kids

### Sample Questions Script

```
I'd love to help plan an amazing birthday! Let me gather some information:

**About the Birthday Child:**
1. What's your child's name (or initial) and how old are they turning?
2. What's their gender?
3. What are they really into right now? (favorite characters, hobbies, colors, activities)
4. Do they have any theme ideas, or should I suggest some based on their interests?

**Date & Location:**
5. What's the actual birthday date?
6. Does your child go to school or daycare?
7. What's your location (city or zip code)? I'll search for options within 30 minutes.

**Guests:**
8. How many kids are you thinking of inviting to the party?
9. What's the general age range of the kids who'd be invited?
10. If we're doing a school celebration, how many kids are in the class?
11. Are there any allergies I should know about (for the party or school treats)?

**Family:**
12. Are there any siblings? If so, what are their ages?
13. Do any younger siblings have nap times I should plan around?

**Budget:**
14. What's your budget range for the party? (rough estimate is fine)

**School (if applicable):**
15. What's the school's policy on birthday treats? Any restrictions?
```

## Age-Based Planning Rules

Use these guidelines to tailor the party plan:

### Ages 1-2 (Toddler)
- **Party Style**: Small, family-focused, short duration (1-1.5 hours max)
- **Venue**: Home party is often best; sensory play spaces if venue desired
- **Loot Bags**: NOT needed (they don't care or understand)
- **Guest List**: Keep very small (family + a few close friends with kids)
- **Food**: Simple finger foods, smash cake for birthday child
- **Timing**: Mid-morning after first nap, or early afternoon after lunch nap
- **Parents**: All parents stay (required for this age)
- **School**: Not typically applicable; daycare may have own policies

### Ages 3-5 (Preschool)
- **Party Style**: Structured but simple, 1.5-2 hours
- **Venue**: Indoor playgrounds, home parties, bounce houses, simple party rooms
- **Loot Bags**: YES - simple items, age-appropriate toys, bubbles, stickers, playdough
- **Guest List**: Small to medium (8-15 kids)
- **Entertainment**: Simple activities - crafts, games, character appearance (if home party)
- **Timing**: Avoid nap times (usually early afternoon or mid-morning)
- **Parents**: Most parents stay, especially for 3-year-olds; some drop-off okay for 5-year-olds
- **School**: Classroom celebration with simple treats

### Ages 6-9 (Elementary)
- **Party Style**: Activity-focused, 2-2.5 hours
- **Venue**: Trampoline parks, bowling, skating rinks, pool parties, sports facilities, escape rooms (age 8+), home parties
- **Loot Bags**: Optional - can do or skip; if doing, focus on useful items or candy
- **Guest List**: Medium (10-20 kids)
- **Entertainment**: Venue usually provides activities; if home, consider hired entertainment
- **Timing**: Flexible; consider sibling schedules
- **Parents**: Drop-off is standard; provide contact info
- **School**: Treats for class, possibly small trinkets

### Ages 10-12 (Tweens)
- **Party Style**: Experience-focused, 2-3 hours
- **Venue**: Escape rooms, laser tag, movie theater, spa parties, cooking classes, sports events, arcade/gaming centers
- **Loot Bags**: Generally skip - experiences over stuff; maybe just candy/small item
- **Guest List**: Smaller, closer friends (6-12 kids)
- **Entertainment**: Venue-based activities
- **Timing**: Flexible; later afternoon/evening can work
- **Parents**: Definitely drop-off
- **School**: Simple treats, may opt out entirely
